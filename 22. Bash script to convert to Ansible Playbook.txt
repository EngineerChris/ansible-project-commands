EXPLANATION OF THE CODE ABOVE


Bash script that automates the deployment process of the Jupiter website. Here's a breakdown of each command:

#!/bin/bash: This line specifies the interpreter to be used, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
sudo su: This command attempts to switch the user to the superuser (root) using sudo. However, this line might not work as intended in a script because it will prompt for a password unless sudo is configured to allow passwordless execution.
yum update -y: This command updates all packages on the system using the YUM package manager (-y flag is used to automatically answer yes to all prompts).
yum install -y httpd: This command installs the Apache HTTP server.
cd /var/www/html: Changes the current working directory to /var/www/html.
wget https://github.com/azeezsalu/jupiter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip: Downloads the main.zip file from the specified GitHub repository.
unzip main.zip: Unzips the downloaded main.zip file.
cp -r jupiter-main/* /var/www/html/: Copies the contents of the extracted jupiter-main directory to /var/www/html/.
rm -rf jupiter-main main.zip: Removes the jupiter-main directory and the downloaded main.zip file.
systemctl enable httpd: Enables the Apache HTTP server to start automatically on system boot.
systemctl start httpd: Starts the Apache HTTP server.
This script is designed to be run on a system where the Apache HTTP server can be installed and configured using the yum package manager. However, as mentioned earlier, the sudo su command might not work as intended in a script, and it's generally recommended to avoid switching users in this manner in automation scripts. Instead, use sudo directly for individual commands that require elevated privileges.
